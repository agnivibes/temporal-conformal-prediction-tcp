**Temporal Conformal Prediction (TCP)** is a novel framework for constructing adaptive, distribution-free prediction intervals in financial time series. 
The methodology and its benchmarking against GARCH, Quantile Regression, and Historical Simulation across S&P 500, Bitcoin, and Gold are thoroughly 
detailed in our accompanying research paper.
🔍 This repository contains both the dataset and the complete implementation code to support full reproducibility.
